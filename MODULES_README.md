# SportAI Modules - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ All 14 Modules Implemented

All modules have been implemented and are ready to use! If you're seeing "Module not yet implemented" messages, follow the steps below.

## 🔧 Quick Fix: Restart Streamlit

The issue is that **Streamlit has cached the old version** before the modules existed. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Use the Restart Script (Recommended)

```bash
./restart_app.sh
```

This script will:
- Stop any running Streamlit processes
- Clear all Streamlit and Python caches
- Restart the application

### Option 2: Manual Restart

```bash
# 1. Stop Streamlit (press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

# 2. Clear caches
rm -rf ~/.streamlit/cache
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +

# 3. Restart
streamlit run sportai_main.py
```

### Option 3: In the Browser

If Streamlit is already running:
1. Press `C` in the Streamlit interface to clear cache
2. Press `R` to rerun
3. Or do a hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

## 📋 Verify Modules

To verify all modules can be loaded, run:

```bash
python3 verify_modules.py
```

This will test all 13 modules and show which ones load successfully.

## ❓ Still Having Issues?

1. Make sure you're on the correct branch:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   # Should show: claude/implement-module-011CUMYTUfkqzBSdKHCsuMfy
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin claude/implement-module-011CUMYTUfkqzBSdKHCsuMfy
   ```

3. Verify modules exist:
   ```bash
   ls -l modules/*.py | wc -l
   # Should show: 14
   ```

4. Check if streamlit is running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep streamlit
   ```

5. Kill all streamlit processes and restart:
   ```bash
   pkill -9 -f streamlit
   ./restart_app.sh
   ```
