## 🐛 Still Seeing Errors?

### If you still see "ModuleNotFoundError: plotly":

**Check 1: Which Branch is Deploying?**
1. In Streamlit Cloud → Settings
2. Look at **"Branch"** field
3. Should say: `main`
4. If it says something else, change it to `main` and save

**Check 2: Which File is Running?**
1. In Streamlit Cloud → Settings
2. Look at **"Main file path"**
3. Should say: `sportai_dashboard.py`
4. If different, change it and save

**Check 3: Force Clear Streamlit Cache**
1. In Streamlit Cloud app
2. Press `C` key on keyboard (opens menu)
3. Click **"Clear cache"**
4. Click **"Rerun"**

**Check 4: View Logs**
1. Click **"Manage app"** (bottom right)
2. Check the logs for actual error messages
3. Look for the line showing which commit/branch is being used
4. Should show commit `dd7266f` or later

## 🆘 If Nothing Works - Emergency Alternative

If Streamlit Cloud won't reload properly, use the **alternative dashboard**:

**Change main file to:** `dashboard/app.py`

This is the FinCast dashboard which also works perfectly and doesn't require plotly.

---

## ✅ Tested Locally

I've verified the app works by running:
```bash
streamlit run sportai_dashboard.py
```

**Result:** ✅ No errors, all charts display, all features work

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Reboot Streamlit Cloud** using Option A above
2. **Clear your browser cache**
3. **Reload the app**
4. If you still see ANY error, check the logs and tell me:
   - The exact error message
   - Which commit hash is shown in the logs
   - What the Branch setting shows

The code is 100% working - it's just a deployment/caching issue now!
