# üö® URGENT: How to Fix Your Streamlit Cloud Deployment

## The Problem

Your Streamlit Cloud app is deploying from `origin/main` (the remote main branch), which **still has the OLD code with the plotly error**.

The **FIX is ready** but stuck on the local repository because I cannot push directly to the main branch (403 permission error - likely due to branch protection).

## ‚úÖ The Fix is Ready On:

**Branch:** `claude/rerun-and-verify-fu-011CUeRakzieYZiuH3wQZsnY`

**Commit:** `dd7266f - Fix ModuleNotFoundError: Replace plotly with matplotlib`

**What was fixed:**
- Removed all plotly dependencies
- Replaced with matplotlib
- All charts working
- Tested and verified ‚úì

## üéØ SOLUTION - Choose ONE Option:

### Option 1: Change Streamlit Cloud to Use Feature Branch (FASTEST - 2 minutes)

1. Go to **Streamlit Cloud Dashboard**: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Find your app and click **‚ãÆ (three dots) ‚Üí Settings**
3. Under **Branch**, change from `main` to:
   ```
   claude/rerun-and-verify-fu-011CUeRakzieYZiuH3wQZsnY
   ```
4. Click **Save**
5. Click **Reboot app**

‚úÖ Your app will work immediately!

---

### Option 2: Merge the Feature Branch into Main (RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION)

If you have repository admin access:

**On GitHub:**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. You should see a yellow banner saying "claude/rerun-and-verify-fu-011CUeRakzieYZiuH3wQZsnY had recent pushes"
3. Click **"Compare & pull request"**
4. Review the changes (you'll see the matplotlib fix)
5. Click **"Create pull request"**
6. Click **"Merge pull request"**
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for Streamlit Cloud to auto-redeploy

**OR Via Command Line** (if you have push access to main):

```bash
# On your local machine or in your terminal
cd /path/to/SportAI-Suite-Enterprise-Edition-v6.0.0

# Pull latest
git fetch origin

# Checkout main
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge origin/claude/rerun-and-verify-fu-011CUeRakzieYZiuH3wQZsnY

# Push to remote main
git push origin main
```

## üìä What's Included in the Fix

The updated `sportai_dashboard.py` now has:

‚úÖ **No plotly dependency** - Uses matplotlib only
‚úÖ **All KPIs working**: Utilization, Revenue, Members, Sponsorships
‚úÖ **All charts working**:
- Revenue Trend (line chart)
- Utilization by Asset Type (bar chart)
- Weekly Schedule Utilization (grouped bars)
- Revenue Mix (pie chart)

‚úÖ **All features preserved**: Alerts, Quick Actions, Data Status

## üîç Why This Happened

Streamlit Cloud deploys from the **remote repository** (GitHub), not your local files. The branch protection on your main branch prevents me from pushing directly, so the fix is on the feature branch waiting for you to merge it.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Check: Which Branch is Streamlit Cloud Using?

1. Go to Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Click on your app
3. Click **‚ãÆ ‚Üí Settings**
4. Look at the **Branch** field

**If it says `main`:** You need to either merge the feature branch to main (Option 2) or change it to the feature branch (Option 1)

**If it says something else:** Change it to `claude/rerun-and-verify-fu-011CUeRakzieYZiuH3wQZsnY`

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

After you apply one of these solutions, the app should load without errors and show:
- üìä Executive Dashboard header
- 4 KPI metrics cards
- 4 charts (Revenue, Utilization, Schedule, Revenue Mix)
- Alerts section
- Quick action buttons

---

## Need Help?

If you continue to see errors after following these steps:
1. Check the Streamlit Cloud logs (click "Manage app" ‚Üí "Logs")
2. Verify the branch name is exactly: `claude/rerun-and-verify-fu-011CUeRakzieYZiuH3wQZsnY`
3. Try clicking "Reboot app" in Streamlit Cloud settings

The code is working and tested - it just needs to be on the branch that Streamlit Cloud is deploying from!
