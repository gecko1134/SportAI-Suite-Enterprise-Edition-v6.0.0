# 🚀 START HERE - Fix Module Loading Issues

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

If you're seeing **"Module not yet implemented. Coming soon!"**, it means:
1. ✅ **Modules ARE installed** (verified - all 14 files exist)
2. ❌ **Streamlit is caching old version** OR **not running from correct directory**

---

## 🔥 STEP-BY-STEP FIX (Follow Exactly)

### Step 1: Find WHERE Streamlit is Running

**In your terminal, type:**
```bash
ps aux | grep streamlit
```

**Results:**
- **If you see output**: Note the terminal/process where it's running
- **If "No processes found"**: Streamlit isn't running (skip to Step 3)

---

### Step 2: STOP Streamlit Completely

**Option A - If you can see the terminal running Streamlit:**
1. Click on that terminal
2. Press `Ctrl + C`
3. Wait until you see the prompt (`$` or `#`)

**Option B - If you can't find it:**
```bash
pkill -9 streamlit
killall -9 streamlit
```

**Verify it's stopped:**
```bash
ps aux | grep streamlit
# Should show: "No processes found" or only the grep command itself
```

---

### Step 3: Clear ALL Caches

**Run these commands ONE BY ONE:**

```bash
# Go to the project directory
cd /home/user/SportAI-Suite-Enterprise-Edition-v6.0.0

# Clear Python cache
rm -rf modules/__pycache__
rm -rf __pycache__
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null

# Clear Streamlit cache
rm -rf ~/.streamlit/cache

# Verify we're in the right place
pwd
# Should show: /home/user/SportAI-Suite-Enterprise-Edition-v6.0.0

# Verify modules exist
ls modules/*.py | wc -l
# Should show: 14
```

---

### Step 4: Start Fresh

**Now start Streamlit from the CORRECT directory:**

```bash
# Make absolutely sure you're in the right place
cd /home/user/SportAI-Suite-Enterprise-Edition-v6.0.0

# Start Streamlit
streamlit run sportai_main.py
```

**You should see:**
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8501
```

---

### Step 5: Open in Browser (FRESH)

**DO NOT use the old browser tab!**

1. **Close any old SportAI tabs** in your browser
2. **Open a NEW tab**
3. Go to: `http://localhost:8501`
4. If it auto-opened, do a **hard refresh**:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

---

### Step 6: Test Login

**Login with admin account:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**You should now see:**
- ✅ 📊 Dashboard
- ✅ 🤖 AI Scheduling
- ✅ 💰 Dynamic Pricing
- ✅ 🤝 Sponsorship
- ✅ 👥 Memberships
- ✅ 🏢 Facility Ops ← **This one especially!**
- ✅ 📄 Grants
- ✅ ⚖️ Governance
- ✅ 📅 Events
- ✅ 📈 Reports

**Click on "Facility Ops" - it should load the full module!**

---

## ❓ STILL NOT WORKING?

### Problem A: "Cannot find sportai_main.py"

**You're in the wrong directory!**
```bash
cd /home/user/SportAI-Suite-Enterprise-Edition-v6.0.0
ls sportai_main.py  # Should show the file
```

---

### Problem B: "Module 'X' not yet implemented"

**The modules aren't where Streamlit is looking. Verify:**

```bash
# Check current directory
pwd

# List modules
ls -la modules/

# Test import (should fail with "No module named 'streamlit'" - that's OK)
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); from modules import facility_ops"
```

**If this shows "No module named 'modules'":**
- You're running from the wrong directory
- Use absolute path: `cd /home/user/SportAI-Suite-Enterprise-Edition-v6.0.0`

---

### Problem C: "Address already in use"

**Another Streamlit is still running:**
```bash
# Kill it
pkill -9 streamlit

# Wait 5 seconds
sleep 5

# Try again
streamlit run sportai_main.py
```

---

### Problem D: Modules appear but are empty

**Browser cache issue:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or use Incognito/Private window

This will show:
- ✅ What's working
- ❌ What's broken
- 💡 Specific fix recommendations

## 📞 WHAT TO REPORT IF STILL BROKEN

If it's STILL not working after all this, run:

```bash
# Gather diagnostic info
cd /home/user/SportAI-Suite-Enterprise-Edition-v6.0.0
python3 diagnose.py > diagnostic_output.txt 2>&1
ps aux | grep streamlit >> diagnostic_output.txt
echo "---" >> diagnostic_output.txt
ls -la modules/ >> diagnostic_output.txt
echo "---" >> diagnostic_output.txt
cat diagnostic_output.txt
```

And share that output.
